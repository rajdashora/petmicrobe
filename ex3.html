						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>This experiment tests how the microbe interacts with organic matter,
							specifically how it affects a cherry tomato. I used two cherry tomatoes.
							One I cut the surface and put a small piece of my microbe on it, the other
							tomato was used as a control, and I simply just cut the surface. Both of these
							were then isolated in petri dishes.
						</p>
						<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
						<p>The tomato will show symptoms associated with fungal plant diseases such as rots and mold.</p>
						<h2>Results</h2>
						<h3>Diseased Tomato:</h3>

						<h3>Control Tomato:</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ct.png" alt="" /></span>
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>My hypothesis for this experiment was somewhat correct. The tomato
							exposed to the microbe did show the symptoms expected. However, the
							control tomato also showed the same symptoms, so we cannot know if
							the microbe was the cause. I was also surprised when I noticed that
							the microbe itself began to grow and spread on the surface of the
							tomato. If I was to redo this experiment, I would want to test tomatoes
							on a living tomato plant to see how the microbe affects the entire plant.
							Unfortunately there isn't much to take away from this experiment besides
							the fact that organic matter such as tomatoes contain the necessary nutrients
							for the microbe to grow.
