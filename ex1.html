							<h1 class="major">Experiment 1</h1>
							<h2>Description</h2>
							<p>The goal of the first experiment was to see what temperature would
								be ideal for the survival of the microbe. In order to test this, I
								transferred the microbe to three petri dishes. I put one petri dish
								in my freezer, one petri dish in my refrigerator, and one on my desk
								as the control plate.
							</p>
							<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
							<p>The microbe will show the most growth in the petri dish being kept in room temperature</p>
							<h2>Results</h2>
							<h3>Freezer Plate:</h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/fz.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Refrigerator Plate:</h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/rf.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Room Temperature Plate (Control):</h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/c.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>My hypothesis was correct. While the plate kept in room temperature
								grew at a normal rate, the refrigerator and freezer plates did not
								show any growth at all. I was a little surprised that the fungus
								could not grow at all in the refrigerator and was expecting growth
								similar to that of the room temperature plate but at a slower rate.
								If I was to redo this experiment, I would try and find a way to
								test with environments warmer than room temperature. I think the control
								plate would continue to grow until space runs out, but i'm doubtful that
								any growth would occur in the plates left in the colder environments.
								This experiment shows us that the microbe is found in areas with
								warmer climates or during warmer seasons.
