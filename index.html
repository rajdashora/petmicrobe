				<h1>The Mystery Microbe</h1>
				<p> This website covers 4 experiments conducted on a microbe taken from a succulent plant.
					These experiments were done with the goal of learning more about this microbe and
					how it interacts with the world. The microbe has a dark green, fuzzy appearance, and
					grows in many circular formations all over the plate.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					We have learned many things from these four experiments. The main takeaways
					are that the microbe is most likely found in areas with warmer climates or
					during warmer seasons, the microbe best grows with access to nutrients, such as
					on a tomato plant, and that the microbe must compete with other microbes for
					resources. I would like to know how common this microbe is on plants like mine,
					and what areas around the world it's most commonly found in. I don't think
					these experiments gave enough information to identify the species of the microbe.
					If I were to try to identify the species, I would continue conduct more experiments,
					starting with the many ideas mentioned in the experiment pages, as well as
					do some research about fungus and my findings.
