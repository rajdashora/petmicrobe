				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this experiment was to see what medium in an agar plate
				would be the best for the microbe to grow in. For this experiment I
				had 3 agar plates, one with PDA which was the control plate, one
				with CV8, and one with a water agar.
				</p>
				<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
				<p>TThe microbe will show the most growth in the plate with PDA.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<h3>CV8 Plate:</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/cv8.png" alt="" /></span>
				<h3>Water Agar Plate:</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/wa.png" alt="" /></span>
				<h3>PDA Plate (Control):</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/c.png" alt="" /></span>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>My hypothesis for this experiment did not end up holding true.
					I was surprised to see that the microbe in the CV8 plate showed more
					growth than the control plate. If I was to redo this experiment, I
					would want to test more media. I believe that the microbes in the
					control and CV8 plates would continue to grow as observed until space
					runs out. Based on the results of this experiment, I don't think there
					would be any growth on the water plate if given more time. We learned
					from this experiment that the microbe best grows with nutrients, and the
					nutrients given can vary.
